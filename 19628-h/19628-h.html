<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Out of some sixty aboriginal stocks or families found in North America
above the Tropic of Cancer, about five-sixths were confined to the
tenth of the territory bordering Pacific ocean; the remaining nine-tenths
of the land was occupied by a few strong stocks, comprising the Algonquian,
Athapascan, Iroquoian, Shoshonean, Siouan, and others of more
limited extent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Indians of the Siouan stock occupied the central portion of the
continent. They were preeminently plains Indians, ranging from Lake
Michigan to the Rocky mountains, and from the Arkansas to the Saskatchewan,
while an outlying body stretched to the shores of the
Atlantic. They were typical American barbarians, headed by hunters
and warriors and grouped in shifting tribes led by the chase or driven
by battle from place to place over their vast and naturally rich domain,
though a crude agriculture sprang up whenever a tribe tarried long in
one spot. No native stock is more interesting than the great Siouan
group, and none save the Algonquian and Iroquoian approach it in
wealth of literary and historical records; for since the advent of white
men the Siouan Indians have played striking rôles on the stage of
human development, and have caught the eye of every thoughtful
observer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The term Siouan is the adjective denoting the "Sioux" Indians and
cognate tribes. The word "Sioux" has been variously and vaguely
used. Originally it was a corruption of a term expressing enmity or
contempt, applied to a part of the plains tribes by the forest-dwelling
Algonquian Indians. According to Trumbull, it was the popular appellation
of those tribes which call themselves Dakota, Lakota, or Nakota<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
("Friendly," implying confederated or allied), and was an abbreviation
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nadowessioux</span></span>, a Canadian-French corruption of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nadowe-ssi-wag</span></span>
("the snake-like ones" or "enemies"), a term rooted in the Algonquian
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nadowe</span></span> ("a snake"); and some writers have applied the designation to
different portions of the stock, while others have rejected it because of
the offensive implication or for other reasons. So long ago as 1836,
however, Gallatin employed the term "Sioux" to designate collectively
"the nations which speak the Sioux language,"<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> and used an alternative
term to designate the subordinate confederacy—i.e., he used the
term in a systematic way for the first time to denote an ethnic unit
which experience has shown to be well defined. Gallatin's terminology
was soon after adopted by Prichard and others, and has been followed
by most careful writers on the American Indians. Accordingly the
name must be regarded as established through priority and prescription,
and has been used in the original sense in various standard
publications.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In colloquial usage and in the usage of the ephemeral press, the
term "Sioux" was applied sometimes to one but oftener to several of
the allied tribes embraced in the first of the principal groups of which
the stock is composed, i.e., the group or confederacy styling themselves
Dakota. Sometimes the term was employed in its simple form,
but as explorers and pioneers gained an inkling of the organization of
the group, it was often compounded with the tribal name as "Santee-Sioux,"
"Yanktonnai-Sioux," "Sisseton-Sioux," etc. As acquaintance
between white men and red increased, the stock name was gradually
displaced by tribe names until the colloquial appellation "Sioux"
became but a memory or tradition throughout much of the territory
formerly dominated by the great Siouan stock. One of the reasons
for the abandonment of the name was undoubtedly its inappropriateness
as a designation for the confederacy occupying the plains of the upper
Missouri, since it was an alien and opprobrious designation for a people
bearing a euphonious appellation of their own. Moreover, colloquial
usage was gradually influenced by the usage of scholars, who accepted
the native name for the Dakota (spelled Dahcota by Gallatin) confederacy,
as well as the tribal names adopted by Gallatin, Prichard, and
others. Thus the ill-defined term "Sioux" has dropped out of use in
the substantive form, and is retained, in the adjective form only, to
designate a great stock to which no other collective name, either intern
or alien, has ever been definitely and justly applied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earlier students of the Siouan Indians recognized the plains
tribes alone as belonging to that stock, and it has only recently been
shown that certain of the native forest-dwellers long ago encountered
by English colonists on the Atlantic coast were closely akin to the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plains Indians in language, institutions, and beliefs. In 1872 Hale
noted a resemblance between the Tutelo and Dakota languages, and this
resemblance was discussed orally and in correspondence with several
students of Indian languages, but the probability of direct connection
seemed so remote that the affinity was not generally accepted. Even
in 1880, after extended comparison with Dakota material (including
that collected by the newly instituted Bureau of Ethnology), this
distinguished investigator was able to detect only certain general similarities
between the Tutelo tongue and the dialects of the Dakota
tribes.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> In 1881 Gatschet made a collection of linguistic material
among the Catawba Indians of South Carolina, and was struck with
the resemblance of many of the vocables to Siouan terms of like meaning,
and began the preparation of a comparative Catawba-Dakota
vocabulary. To this the Tutelo, ¢egiha, ʇɔiwe´re, and Hotcañgara
(Winnebago) were added by Dorsey, who made a critical examination
of all Catawba material extant and compared it with several Dakota
dialects, with which he was specially conversant. These examinations
and comparisons demonstrated the affinity between the Dakota and
Catawba tongues and showed them to be of common descent; and the
establishment of this relation made easy the acceptance of the affinity
suggested by Hale between the Dakota and Tutelo.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this time it was supposed that the eastern tribes "were merely
offshoots of the Dakota;" but in 1883 Hale observed that "while the
language of these eastern tribes is closely allied to that of the western
Dakota, it bears evidence of being older in form,"<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> and consequently
that the Siouan tribes of the interior seem to have migrated westward
from a common fatherland with their eastern brethren bordering the
Atlantic. Subsequently Gatschet discovered that the Biloxi Indians
of the Gulf coast used many terms common to the Siouan tongues; and
in 1891 Dorsey visited these Indians and procured a rich collection of
words, phrases, and myths, whereby the Siouan affinity of these Indians
was established. Meantime Mooney began researches among the Cherokee
and cognate tribes of the southern Atlantic slope and found fresh
evidence that their ancient neighbors were related in tongue and belief
with the buffalo hunters of the plains; and he has recently set forth
the relations of the several Atlantic slope tribes of Siouan affinity in full
detail.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> Through the addition of these eastern tribes the great Siouan
stock is augmented in extent and range and enhanced in interest; for
the records of a group of cognate tribes are thereby increased so fully
as to afford historical perspective and to indicate, if not clearly to display,
the course of tribal differentiation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to Dorsey, whose acquaintance with the Siouan Indians
was especially close, the main portion of the Siouan stock, occupying
the continental interior, comprised seven principal divisions (including<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Biloxi and not distinguishing the Asiniboin), each composed of
one or more tribes or confederacies, all defined and classified by linguistic,
social, and mythologic relations; and he and Mooney recognize
several additional groups, denned by linguistic affinity or historical evidence
of intimate relations, in the eastern part of the country. So far
as made out through the latest researches, the grand divisions, confederacies,
and tribes of the stock,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> with their present condition, are as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The definition of the first six of these divisions is based on extended
researches among the tribes and in the literature representing the
work of earlier observers, and may be regarded as satisfactory. In some
cases, notably the Dakota confederacy, the constitution of the divisions
is also satisfactory, though in others, including the Asiniboin,
Mandan, and Winnebago, the tabulation represents little more than
superficial enumeration of villages and bands, generally by observers
possessing little knowledge of Indian sociology or language. So far
as the survivors of the Biloxi are concerned the classification is satisfactory;
but there is doubt concerning the former limits of the
division, and also concerning the relations of the extinct tribes referred
to on slender, yet the best available, evidence. The classification of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the extinct and nearly extinct Siouan Indians of the east is much less
satisfactory. In several cases languages are utterly lost, and in others
a few doubtful terms alone remain. In these cases affinity is inferred
in part from geographic relation, but chiefly from the recorded federation
of tribes and union of remnants as the aboriginal population
faded under the light of brighter intelligence; and in all such instances
it has been assumed that federation and union grew out of that conformity
in mode of thought which is characteristic of peoples speaking
identical or closely related tongues. Accordingly, while the grouping
of eastern tribes rests in part on meager testimony and is open to
question at many points, it is perhaps the best that can be devised,
and suffices for convenience of statement if not as a final classification.
So far as practicable the names adopted for the tribes, confederacies,
and other groups are those in common use, the aboriginal designations,
when distinct, being added in those cases in which they are known.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present population of the Siouan stock is probably between
40,000 and 45,000, including 2,000 or more (mainly Asiniboin) in
Canada.</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">TRIBAL NOMENCLATURE</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Siouan stock, as among the American Indians generally, the
accepted appellations for tribes and other groups are variously derived.
Many of the Siouan tribal names were, like the name of the stock,
given by alien peoples, including white men, though most are founded
on the descriptive or other designations used in the groups to which
they pertain. At first glance, the names seem to be loosely applied
and perhaps vaguely defined, and this laxity in application and definition
does not disappear, but rather increases, with closer examination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are special reasons for the indefiniteness of Indian nomenclature:
The aborigines were at the time of discovery, and indeed
most of them remain today, in the prescriptorial stage of culture, i.e.,
the stage in which ideas are crystallized, not by means of arbitrary
symbols, but by means of arbitrary associations,<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> and in this stage
names are connotive or descriptive, rather than denotive as in the
scriptorial stage. Moreover, among the Indians, as among all other
prescriptorial peoples, the ego is paramount, and all things are
described, much more largely than among cultured peoples, with
reference to the describer and the position which he occupies—Self
and Here, and, if need be, Now and Thus, are the fundamental elements
of primitive conception and description, and these elements
are implied and exemplified, rather than expressed, in thought and
utterance. Accordingly there is a notable paucity in names, especially
for themselves, among the Indian tribes, while the descriptive
designations applied to a given group by neighboring tribes are
often diverse.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principles controlling nomenclature in its inchoate stages are
illustrated among the Siouan peoples. So far as their own tongues were
concerned, the stock was nameless, and could not be designated save
through integral parts. Even the great Dakota confederacy, one of the
most extensive and powerful aboriginal organizations, bore no better
designation than a term probably applied originally to associated tribes
in a descriptive way and perhaps used as a greeting or countersign,
although there was an alternative proper descriptive term.—"Seven
Council-fires"—apparently of considerable antiquity, since it seems to
have been originally applied before the separation of the Asiniboin.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>
In like manner the ¢egiha, ʇɔiwe're, and Hotcañgara groups, and perhaps
the Niya, were without denotive designations for themselves, merely
styling themselves "Local People," "Men," "Inhabitants," or, still more
ambitiously, "People of the Parent Speech," in terms which are variously
rendered by different interpreters; they were lords in their own domain,
and felt no need for special title. Different Dakota tribes went so far
as to claim that their respective habitats marked the middle of the
world, so that each insisted on precedence as the leading tribe,<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> and
it was the boast of the Mandan that they were the original people of
the earth.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> In the more carefully studied confederacies the constituent
groups generally bore designations apparently used for convenient distinction
in the confederation; sometimes they were purely descriptive,
as in the case of the Sisseton, Wahpeton, Sans Arcs, Blackfeet, Oto, and
several others; again they referred to the federate organization (probably,
possibly to relative position of habitat), as in the Yankton, Yanktonai,
and Huñkpapa; more frequently they referred to geographic or
topographic position, e.g., Teton, Omaha, Pahe'tsi, Kwapa, etc; while
some appear to have had a figurative or symbolic connotation, as Brulé,
Ogalala, and Ponka. Usually the designations employed by alien peoples
were more definite than those used in the group designated, as
illustrated by the stock name, Asiniboin, and Iowa. Commonly the
alien appellations were terms of reproach; thus Sioux, Biloxi, and
Hohe (the Dakota designation for the Asiniboin) are clearly opprobrious,
while Paskagula might easily be opprobrious among hunters and
warriors, and Iowa and Oto appear to be derogatory or contemptuous
expressions. The names applied by the whites were sometimes taken
from geographic positions, as in the case of Upper Yanktonai and
Cape Fear—the geographic names themselves being frequently of
Indian origin. Some of the current names represent translations of
the aboriginal terms either into English ("Blackfeet," "Two Kettles,"
"Crow,") or into French ("Sans Arcs," "Brulé"," "Gros Ventres");
yet most of the names, at least of the prairie tribes, are simply corruptions
of the aboriginal terms, though frequently the modification is
so complete as to render identification and interpretation difficult—it<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is not easy to find Waca'ce in "Osage" (so spelled by the French, whose
orthography was adopted and mispronounced by English-speaking
pioneers), or Pa'qotce in "Iowa."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meanings of most of the eastern names are lost; yet so far as
they are preserved they are of a kind with those of the interior. So,
too, are the subtribal names enumerated by Dorsey.</p>

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">PHONETIC AND GRAPHIC ARTS</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Siouan stock is defined by linguistic characters. The several
tribes and larger and smaller groups speak dialects so closely related
as to imply occasional or habitual association, and hence to indicate
community in interests and affinity in development; and while the arts
(reflecting as they did the varying environment of a wide territorial
range) were diversified, the similarity in language was, as is usual,
accompanied by similarity in institutions and beliefs. Nearly all of
the known dialects are eminently vocalic, and the tongues of the plains,
which have been most extensively studied, are notably melodious; thus
the leading languages of the group display moderately high phonetic
development. In grammatic structure the better-known dialects are
not so well developed; the structure is complex, chiefly through the large
use of inflection, though agglutination sometimes occurs. In some cases
the germ of organization is found in fairly definite juxtaposition or
placement. The vocabulary is moderately rich, and of course represents
the daily needs of a primitive people, their surroundings, their avocations,
and their thoughts, while expressing little of the richer ideation
of cultured cosmopolites. On the whole, the speech of the Siouan stock
may be said to have been fairly developed, and may, with the Algonquian,
Iroquoian, and Shoshonean, be regarded as typical for the portion
of North America lying north of Mexico. Fortunately it has been
extensively studied by Riggs, Hale, Dorsey, and several others, including
distinguished representatives of some of the tribes, and is thus
accessible to students. The high phonetic development of the Siouan
tongues reflects the needs and records the history of the hunter and
warrior tribes, whose phonetic symbols were necessarily so differentiated
as to be intelligible in whisper, oratory, and war cry, as well as
in ordinary converse, while the complex structure is in harmony with
the elaborate social organization and ritual of the Siouan people.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the Siouan Indians were adepts in the sign language;
indeed, this mode of conveying intelligence attained perhaps its highest
development among some of the tribes of this stock, who, with
other plains Indians, developed pantomime and gesture into a surprisingly
perfect art of expression adapted to the needs of huntsmen and
warriors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the tribes were fairly proficient in pictography; totemic and
other designs were inscribed on bark and wood, painted on skins,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wrought into domestic wares, and sometimes carved on rocks. Jonathan
Carver gives an example of picture-writing on a tree, in charcoal
mixed with bear's grease, designed to convey information from the
"Chipe'ways" (Algonquian) to the "Naudowessies,"<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> and other instances
of intertribal communication by means of pictography are on record.
Personal decoration was common, and was largely symbolic; the face
and body were painted in distinctive ways when going on the warpath,
in organizing the hunt, in mourning the dead, in celebrating the victory,
and in performing various ceremonials. Scarification and maiming
were practiced by some of the tribes, always in a symbolic way.
Among the Mandan and Hidatsa scars were produced in cruel ceremonials
originally connected with war and hunting, and served as enduring
witnesses of courage and fortitude. Symbolic tattooing was fairly
common among the westernmost tribes. Eagle and other feathers were
worn as insignia of rank and for other symbolic purposes, while bear
claws and the scalps of enemies were worn as symbols of the chase
and battle. Some of the tribes recorded current history by means of
"winter counts" or calendaric inscriptions, though their arithmetic
was meager and crude, and their calendar proper was limited to recognition
of the year, lunation, and day—or, as among so many primitive
people, the "snow," "dead moon," and "night,"—with no definite system
of fitting lunations to the annual seasons. Most of the graphic
records were perishable, and have long ago disappeared; but during
recent decades several untutored tribesmen have executed vigorous
drawings representing hunting scenes and conflicts with white soldiery,
which have been preserved or reproduced. These crude essays in
graphic art were the germ of writing, and indicate that, at the time of
discovery, several Siouan tribes were near the gateway opening into
the broader field of scriptorial culture. So far as it extends, the crude
graphic symbolism betokens warlike habit and militant organization,
which were doubtless measurably inimical to further progress.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would appear that, in connection with their proficiency in gesture
speech and their meager graphic art, the Siouan Indians had become
masters in a vaguely understood system of dramaturgy or symbolized
conduct. Among them the use of the peace-pipe was general; among
several and perhaps all of the tribes the definite use of insignia was common;
among them the customary hierarchic organization of the aborigines
was remarkably developed and was maintained by an elaborate
and strict code of etiquette whose observance was exacted and yielded
by every tribesman. Thus the warriors, habituated to expressing and
recognizing tribal affiliation and status in address and deportment, were
notably observant of social minutiæ, and this habit extended into every
activity of their lives. They were ceremonious among themselves and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
crafty toward enemies, tactful diplomatists as well as brave soldiers,
shrewd strategists as well as fierce fighters; ever they were skillful
readers of human nature, even when ruthless takers of human life.
Among some of the tribes every movement and gesture and expression
of the male adult seems to have been affected or controlled with
the view of impressing spectators and auditors, and through constant
schooling the warriors became most consummate actors. To the casual
observer, they were stoics or stupids according to the conditions of
observation; to many observers, they were cheats or charlatans; to
scientific students, their eccentrically developed volition and the thaumaturgy
by which it was normally accompanied suggests early stages
in that curious development which, in the Orient, culminates in necromancy
and occultism. Unfortunately this phase of the Indian character
(which was shared by various tribes) was little appreciated by
the early travelers, and little record of it remains; yet there is enough
to indicate the importance of constantly studied ceremony, or symbolic
conduct, among them. The development of affectation and self-control
among the Siouan tribesmen was undoubtedly shaped by warlike disposition,
and their stoicism was displayed largely in war—as when the
captured warrior went exultingly to the torture, taunting and tempting
his captors to multiply their atrocities even until his tongue was torn
from its roots, in order that his fortitude might be proved; but the
habit was firmly fixed and found constant expression in commonplace
as well as in more dramatic actions.</p>

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">INDUSTRIAL AND ESTHETIC ARTS</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the arts of primitive people reflect environmental conditions
with close fidelity, and since the Siouan Indians were distributed over
a vast territory varying in climate, hydrography, geology, fauna, and
flora, their industrial and esthetic arts can hardly be regarded as distinctive,
and were indeed shared by other tribes of all neighboring
stocks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best developed industries were hunting and warfare, though all
of the tribes subsisted in part on fruits, nuts, berries, tubers, grains,
and other vegetal products, largely wild, though sometimes planted
and even cultivated in rude fashion. The southwestern tribes, and to
some extent all of the prairie denizens and probably the eastern remnant,
grew maize, beans, pumpkins, melons, squashes, sunflowers, and
tobacco, though their agriculture seems always to have been subordinated
to the chase. Aboriginally, they appear to have had no domestic
animals except dogs, which, according to Carver—one of the first
white men seen by the prairie tribes,—were kept for their flesh, which
was eaten ceremonially,<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> and for use in the chase.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> According to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

according to the naturalists accompanying Long's expedition (1819-20),
for flesh (eaten ceremonially and on ordinary occasions), draft, burden,
and the chase,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> and according to Prince Maximilian, for food and
draft,<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> all these functions indicating long familiarity with the canines.
Catlin, too, found "dog's meat ... the most honorable food that
can be presented to a stranger;" it was eaten ceremonially and on
important occasions.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> Moreover, the terms used for the dog and his
harness are ancient and even archaic, and some of the most important
ceremonials were connected with this animal,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> implying long-continued
association. Casual references indicate that some of the tribes lived
in mutual tolerance with several birds<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> and mammals not yet domesticated
(indeed the buffalo may be said to have been in this condition),
so that the people were at the threshold of zooculture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief implements and weapons were of stone, wood, bone, horn,
and antler. According to Carver, the "Nadowessie" were skillful bowmen,
using also the "casse-tête"<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> or warclub, and a flint scalping-knife.
Catlin was impressed with the shortness of the bows used
by the prairie tribes, though among the southwestern tribes they were
longer. Many of the Siouan Indians used the lance, javelin, or spear.
The domestic utensils were scant and simple, as became wanderers
and fighters, wood being the common material, though crude pottery<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and basketry were manufactured, together with bags and bottles of
skins or animal intestines. Ceremonial objects were common, the
most conspicuous being the calumet, carved out of the sacred pipestone
or catlinite quarried for many generations in the midst of the
Siouan territory. Frequently the pipes were fashioned in the form of
tomahawks, when they carried a double symbolic significance, standing
alike for peace and war, and thus expressing well the dominant
idea of the Siouan mind. Tobacco and kinnikinic (a mixture of tobacco
with shredded bark, leaves, etc<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>) were smoked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aboriginally the Siouan apparel was scanty, commonly comprising
breechclout, moccasins, leggings, and robe, and consisted chiefly of
dressed skins, though several of the tribes made simple fabrics of bast,
rushes, and other vegetal substances. Fur robes and rush mats commonly
served for bedding, some of the tribes using rude bedsteads.
The buffalo-hunting prairie tribes depended largely for apparel, bedding,
and habitations, as well as for food, on the great beast to whose
comings and goings their movements were adjusted. Like other
Indians, the Siouan hunters and their consorts quickly availed themselves
of the white man's stuffs, as well as his metal implements, and
the primitive dress was soon modified.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The woodland habitations were chiefly tent-shape structures of saplings
covered with bark, rush mats, skins, or bushes; the prairie habitations
were mainly earth lodges for winter and buffalo-skin tipis for
summer. Among many of the tribes these domiciles, simple as they
were, were constructed in accordance with an elaborate plan controlled
by ritual. According to Morgan, the framework of the aboriginal
Dakota house consisted of 13 poles;<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> and Dorsey describes the systematic
grouping of the tipis belonging to different gentes and tribes.
Sudatories were characteristic in most of the tribes, menstrual lodges
were common, and most of the more sedentary tribes had council
houses or other communal structures. The Siouan domiciles were thus
adapted with remarkable closeness to the daily habits and environment
of the tribesmen, while at the same time they reflected the complex
social organization growing out of their prescriptorial status and
militant disposition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the Siouan men, women, and children were fine swimmers,
though they did not compare well with neighboring tribes as makers
and managers of water craft. The Dakota women made coracles of
buffalo hides, in which they transported themselves and their householdry,
but the use of these and other craft seems to have been regarded
as little better than a feminine weakness. Other tribes were better
boatmen; for the Siouan Indian generally preferred land travel to
journeying by water, and avoided the burden of vehicles by which his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ever-varying movements in pursuit of game or in waylaying and evading
enemies would have been limited and handicapped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many indications and some suggestive evidences that the
chief arts and certain institutions and beliefs, as well as the geographic
distribution, of the principal Siouan tribes were determined by a single
conspicuous feature in their environment—the buffalo. As Riggs,
Hale, and Dorsey have demonstrated, the original home of the Siouan
stock lay on the eastern slope of the Appalachian mountains, stretching
down over the Piedmont and Coastplain provinces to the shores of
the Atlantic between the Potomac and the Savannah. As shown by
Allen, the buffalo, "prior to the year 1800," spread eastward across the
Appalachians<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> and into the priscan territory of the Siouan tribes. As
suggested by Shaler, the presence of this ponderous and peaceful
animal materially affected the vocations of the Indians, tending to discourage
agriculture and encourage the chase; and it can hardly be
doubted that the bison was the bridge that carried the ancestors of the
western tribes from the crest of the Alleghenies to the Côteau des
Prairies and enabled them to disperse so widely over the plains beyond.
Certainly the toothsome flesh and useful skins must have attracted
the valiant huntsmen among the Appalachians; certainly the feral
herds must have become constantly larger and more numerous westward,
thus tempting the pursuers down the waterways toward the
great river; certainly the vast herds beyond the Mississippi gave
stronger incentives and richer rewards than the hunters of big game
found elsewhere; and certainly when the prairie tribes were discovered,
the men and animals lived in constant interaction, and many of the
hunters acted and thought only as they were moved by their easy prey.
As the Spanish horse spread northward over the Llano Estacado and
overflowed across the mountains from the plains of the Cayuse, the
Dakota and other tribes found a new means of conquest over the
herds, and entered on a career so facile that they increased and multiplied
despite strife and imported disease.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horse was acquired by the prairie tribes toward the end of the
last century. Carver (1766-1768) describes the methods of hunting
among the "Naudowessie" without referring to the horse,<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> though he
gives their name for the animal in his vocabulary,<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> and describes their
mode of warfare with "Indians that inhabit still farther to the westward
a country which extends to the South Sea," having "great plenty
of horses."<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> Lewis and Clark (1804-1806) mention that the "Sioux of
the Teton tribe ... frequently make excursions to steal horses"
from the Mandan,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> and make other references indicating that the horse<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was in fairly common use among some of the Siouan tribes, though the
animal was "confined principally to the nations inhabiting the great
plains of the Columbia,"<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> and dogs were still used for burden and
draft.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> Grinnell learned from an aged Indian that horses came into
the hands of the neighboring Piegan (Algonquian) about 1804-1806.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
Long's naturalists found the horse, ass, and mule in use among the
Kansa and other tribes,<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> and described the mode of capture of wild
horses by the Osage;<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> yet when, two-thirds of a century after Carver,
Catlin (1832-1839) and Prince Maximilian (1833-34) visited the Siouan
territory, they found the horse established and in common use in the
chase and in war.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> It is significant that the Dakota word for horse
(śuk-taɲ'-ka or śuɲ-ka'-wa-kaɲ) is composed of the word for dog
(śuɲ'-ka), with an affix indicating greatness, sacredness, or mystery,
so that the horse is literally "great mysterious dog," or "ancient sacred
dog," and that several terms for harness and other appurtenances correspond
with those used for the gear of the dog when used as a draft
animal.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> This terminology corroborates the direct evidence that the
dog was domesticated by the Siouan aborigines long before the advent
of the horse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Siouan tribes, as among other Indians, amusements
absorbed a considerable part of the time and energy of the old and
young of both sexes. Among the young, the gambols, races, and
other sports were chiefly or wholly diversional, and commonly mimicked
the avocations of the adults. The girls played at the building
and care of houses and were absorbed in dolls, while the boys played
at archery, foot racing, and mimic hunting, which soon grew into
the actual chase of small birds and animals. Some of the sports of the
elders were unorganized diversions, leaping, racing, wrestling, and
other spontaneous expressions of exuberance. Certain diversions were
controlled by more persistent motive, as when the idle warrior occupied
his leisure in meaningless ornamentation of his garment or tipi, or
spent hours of leisure in esthetic modification of his weapon or ceremonial
badge, and to this purposeless activity, which engendered
design with its own progress, the incipient graphic art of the tribes
was largely due. The more important and characteristic sports were
organized and interwoven with social organization and belief so as
commonly to take the form of elaborate ceremonial, in which dancing,
feasting, fasting, symbolic painting, song, and sacrifice played important
parts, and these organized sports were largely fiducial. To many<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the early observers the observances were nothing more than meaningless
mummeries; to some they were sacrilegious, to others sortilegious;
to the more careful students, like Carver, whose notes are of
especial value by reason of the author's clear insight into the Indian
character, they were invocations, expiations, propitiations, expressing
profound and overpowering devotion. Carver says of the "Naudowessie,"
"They usually dance either before or after every meal; and
by this cheerfulness, probably, render the Great Spirit, to whom they
consider themselves as indebted for every good, a more acceptable
sacrifice than a formal and unanimated thanksgiving;"<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> and he proceeds
to describe the informal dances as well as the more formal ceremonials
preparatory to joining in the chase or setting out on the
warpath. The ceremonial observances of the Siouan tribes were not
different in kind from those of neighboring contemporaries, yet some
of them were developed in remarkable degree—for example, the bloody
rites by which youths were raised to the rank of warriors in some of
the prairie tribes were without parallel in severity among the aborigines
of America, or even among the known primitive peoples of the
world. So the sports of the Siouan Indians were both diversional and
divinatory, and the latter were highly organized in a manner reflecting
the environment of the tribes, their culture-status, their belief, and
especially their disposition toward bloodshed; for their most characteristic
ceremonials were connected, genetically if not immediately,
with warfare and the chase.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among many of the Siouan tribes, games of chance were played
habitually and with great avidity, both men and women becoming so
absorbed as to forget avocations and food, mothers even neglecting
their children; for, as among other primitive peoples, the charm of
hazard was greater than among the enlightened. The games were not
specially distinctive, and were less widely differentiated than in certain
other Indian stocks. The sport or game of chungke stood high in favor
among the young men in many of the tribes, and was played as a game
partly of chance, partly of skill; but dice games (played with plum
stones among the southwestern prairie tribes) were generally preferred,
especially by the women, children, and older men. The games were
partly, sometimes wholly, diversional, but generally they were in large
part divinatory, and thus reflected the hazardous occupations and low
culture-status of the people. One of the evils resulting from the advent
of the whites was the introduction of new games of chance which tended
further to pervert the simple Siouan mind; but in time the evil brought
its own remedy, for association with white gamblers taught the ingenuous
sortilegers that there is nothing divine or sacred about the gaming
table or the conduct of its votaries.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The primitive Siouan music was limited to the chant and rather
simple vocal melody, accompanied by rattle, drum, and flute, the drum
among the northwestern tribes being a skin bottle or bag of water.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The music of the Omaha and some other tribes has been most appreciatively
studied by Miss Fletcher, and her memoir ranks among the
Indian classics.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> In general the Siouan music was typical for the
aboriginal stocks of the northern interior. Its dominant feature was
rhythm, by which the dance was controlled, though melody was inchoate,
while harmony was not yet developed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The germ of painting was revealed in the calendars and the seed of
sculpture in the carvings of the Sionan Indians. The pictographic
paintings comprised not only recognizable but even vigorous representations
of men and animals, depicted in form and color though without
perspective, while the calumet of catlinite was sometimes chiseled into
striking verisimilitude of human and animal forms in miniature. To
the collector these representations suggest fairly developed art, though
to the Indian they were mainly, if not wholly, symbolic; for everything
indicates that the primitive artisan had not yet broken the shackles of
fetichistic symbolism, and had little conception of artistic portrayal for
its own sake.</p>

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">INSTITUTIONS</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among civilized peoples, institutions are crystallized in statutes
about nuclei of common law or custom; among peoples in the prescriptorial
culture-stage statutes are unborn, and various mnemonic devices
are employed for fixing and perpetuating institutions; and, as is usual
in this stage, the devices involve associations which appear to be
essentially arbitrary at the outset, though they tend to become natural
through the survival of the fittest. A favorite device for perpetuating
institutions among the primitive peoples of many districts on different
continents is the taboo, or prohibition, which is commonly fiducial but
is often of general application. This device finds its best development
in the earlier stages in the development of belief, and is normally connected
with totemism. Another device, which is remarkably widespread,
as shown by Morgan, is kinship nomenclature. This device rests
on a natural and easily ascertained basis, though its applications are
arbitrary and vary widely from tribe to tribe and from culture-status
to culture-status. A third device, which found much favor among the
American aborigines and among some other primitive peoples, may be
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ordination</span></span>, or the arrangement of individuals and groups classified
from the prescriptorial point of view of Self, Here, and Now, with
respect to each other or to some dominant personage or group. This
device seems to have grown out of the kin-name system, in which the
Ego is the basis from which relation is reckoned. It tends to develop
into federate organization on the one hand or into caste on the other
hand, according to the attendant conditions.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> There are various other<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
devices for fixing and perpetuating institutions or for expressing the
laws embodied therein. Some of these are connected with thaumaturgy
and shamanism, some are connected with the powers of nature, and
the several devices overlap and interlace in puzzling fashion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Siouan Indians the devices of taboo, kin-names, and ordination
are found in such relation as to throw some light on the growth
of primitive institutions. While they blend and are measurably
involved with thaumaturgic devices, there are indications that in a
general way the three devices stand for stages in the development of
law. Among the best-known tribes the taboo pertained to the clan,
and was used (in a much more limited way than among some other
peoples) to commemorate and perpetuate the clan organization; kin-names,
which were partly natural and thus normal to the clan organization,
and at the same time partly artificial and thus characteristic of
gentile organization, served to commemorate and perpetuate not only
the family relations but the relations of the constituent elements of
the tribe; while the ordination, expressed in the camping circle, in the
phratries, in the ceremonials, and in many other ways, served to commemorate
intertribal as well as intergentile relations, and thus to promote
peace and harmonious action. It is significant that the taboo
was less potent among the Siouan Indians than among some other
stocks, and that among some tribes it has not been found; and it is
especially significant that in some instances the taboo was apparently
inversely related to kin-naming and ordination, as among the Biloxi,
where the taboo is exceptionally weak and kin-naming exceptionally
strong, and among the Dakota, where the system of ordination attained
perhaps its highest American development in domiciliary arrangement,
while the taboo was limited in function; for the relations indicate that
the taboo was archaic or even vestigial. It is noteworthy also that
among most of the Siouan tribes the kin-name system was less elaborate
than in many other stocks, while the system of ordination is so elaborate
as to constitute one of the leading characteristics of the stock.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time of the discovery, most of the Siouan tribes had apparently
passed into gentile organization, though vestiges of clan organization
were found—e.g., among the best-known tribes the man was the head
of the family, though the tipi usually belonged to the woman. Thus, as
defined by institutions, the stock was just above savagery and just
within the lower stages of barbarism. Accordingly the governmental
functions were hereditary in the male line, yet the law of heredity was
subject to modification or suspension at the will of the group, commonly
at the instance of rebels or usurpers of marked prowess or shrewdness.
The property regulations were definite and strictly observed; as among
other barbarous peoples, the land was common to the tribe or other group
occupying it, yet was defended against alien invasion; the ownership
of movable property was a combination of communalism and individualism
delicately adjusted to the needs and habits of the several tribes—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in general, evanescent property, such as food and fuel, was shared in
common (subject to carefully regulated individual claims), while permanent
property, such as tipis, dogs, apparel, weapons, etc, was held by
individuals. As among other tribes, the more strictly personal property
was usually destroyed on the death of the owner, though the real reason
for the custom—the prevention of dispute—was shrouded in a mantle
of mysticism.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although of primary importance in shaping the career of the Siouan
tribes, the marital institutions of the stock were not specially distinctive.
Marriage was usually effected by negotiation through parents or elders;
among some of the tribes the bride was purchased, while among others
there was an interchange of presents. Polygyny was common; in several
of the tribes the bride's sisters became subordinate wives of the
husband. The regulations concerning divorce and the punishment of
infidelity were somewhat variable among the different tribes, some of
whom furnished temporary wives to distinguished visitors. Generally
there were sanctions for marriage by elopement or individual choice. In
every tribe, so far as known, gentile exogamy prevailed—i.e., marriage
in the gens was forbidden, under pain of ostracism or still heavier penalty,
while the gentes intermarried among one another; in some cases
intermarriage between certain tribes was regarded with special favor.
There seems to have been no system of marriage by capture, though
captive women were usually espoused by the successful tribesmen, and
girls were sometimes abducted. In general it would appear that intergentile
and intertribal marriage was practiced and sanctioned by the
sages, and that it tended toward harmony and federation, and thus
contributed much toward the increase and diffusion of the great Siouan
stock.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As set forth in some detail by Dorsey, the ordination of the Siouan
tribes extended beyond the hierarchic organization into families, subgentes,
gentes, tribes, and confederacies; there were also phratries,
sometimes (perhaps typically) arranged in pairs; there were societies
or associations established on social or fiducial bases; there was a general
arrangement or classification of each group on a military basis,
as into soldiers and two or more classes of noncombatants, etc.
Among the Siouan peoples, too, the individual brotherhood of the
David-Jonathan or Damon-Pythias type was characteristically developed.
Thus the corporate institutions were interwoven and superimposed
in a manner nearly as complex as that found in the national,
state, municipal, and minor institutions of civilization; yet the ordination
preserved by means of the camping circle, the kinship system,
the simple series of taboos, and the elaborate symbolism was apparently
so complete as to meet every social and governmental demand.</p>

<h5 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">THE DEVELOPMENT OF MYTHOLOGY</h5>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As explained by Powell, philosophies and beliefs may be seriated in
four stages: The first stage is hecastotheism; in this stage extranatural
or mysterious potencies are imputed to objects both animate<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and inanimate. The second stage is zootheism; within it the powers
of animate forms are exaggerated and amplified into the realm of the
supernal, and certain animals are deified. The third stage is that of
physitheism, in which the agencies of nature are personified and
exalted unto omnipotence. The fourth stage is that of psychotheism,
which includes the domain of spiritual concept. In general the development
of belief coincides with the growth of abstraction; yet it is to
be remembered that this growth represents increase in definiteness of
the abstract concepts rather than augmentation in numbers and kinds
of subjective impressions, i.e., the advance is in quality rather than
in quantity; indeed, it would almost appear that the vague and indefinite
abstraction of hecastotheism is more pervasive and prevalent than
the clearer abstraction of higher stages. Appreciation of the fundamental
characteristics of belief is essential to even the most general
understanding of the Indian mythology and philosophy, and even after
careful study it is difficult for thinkers trained in the higher methods
of thought to understand the crude and confused ideation of the
primitive thinker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In hecastotheism the believer finds mysterious properties and potencies
everywhere. To his mind every object is endued with occult
power, moved by a vague volition, actuated by shadowy motive ranging
capriciously from malevolence to benevolence; in his lax estimation
some objects are more potent or more mysterious than others, the
strong, the sharp, the hard, and the swift-moving rising superior to
the feeble, the dull, the soft, and the slow. Commonly he singles out
some special object as his personal, family, or tribal mystery-symbol
or fetich, the object usually representing that which is most feared or
worst hated among his surroundings. Vaguely realizing from the
memory of accidents or unforeseen events that he is dependent on his
surroundings, he invests every feature of his environment with a
capricious humor reflecting his own disposition, and gives to each and
all a subtlety and inscrutability corresponding to his exalted estimation
of his own craft in the chase and war; and, conceiving himself to
live and move only at the mercy of his multitudinous associates, he
becomes a fatalist—kismet is his watchword, and he meets defeat and
death with resignation, just as he goes to victory with complacence;
for so it was ordained.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zootheism is the offspring of hecastotheism. As the primitive
believer assigns special potency or mystery to the strong and the swift,
he gradually comes to give exceptional rank to self-moving animals;
as his experience of the strength, alertness, swiftness, and courage of
his animate enemy or prey increases, these animals are invested with
successively higher and higher attributes, each reflecting the mental
operations of the mystical huntsman, and in time the animals with
which the primitive believers are most intimately associated come to be
regarded as tutelary daimons of supernatural power and intelligence.
At first the animals, like the undifferentiated things of hecastotheism,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are regarded in fear or awe by reason of their strength and ferocity,
and this regard grows into an incipient worship in the form of sacrifice
or other ceremonial; meanwhile, inanimate things, and in due season
rare and unimportant animals, are neglected, and a half dozen, a dozen,
or a score of the well-known animals are exalted into a hierarchy of
petty gods, headed by the strongest like the bear, the swiftest like the
deer, the most majestic like the eagle, the most cunning like the fox
or coyote, or the most deadly like the rattlesnake. Commonly the
arts and the skill of the mystical huntsman improve from youth to
adolescence and from generation to generation, so that the later animals
appear to be easier snared or slain than the earlier; moreover, the
accounts of conflicts between men and animals grow by repetition
and are gilded by imagination as memory grows dim; and for these
and other reasons the notion grows up that the ancient animals were
stronger, swifter, slier, statelier, deadlier than their modern representatives,
and the hierarchy of petty gods is exalted into an omnipotent
thearchy. Eventually, in the most highly developed zootheistic systems,
the leading beast-god is regarded as the creator of the lesser
deities of the earth, sun, and sky, of the mythic under-world and its
real counterpart the ground or mid-world, as well as the visionary
upper-world, of men, and of the ignoble animals; sometimes the most exalted
beast-god is worshiped especially by the great man or leading class
and incidentally by all, while other men and groups choose the lesser
beast-gods, according to their rank, for special worship. In hecastotheism
the potencies revered or worshiped are polymorphic, while their
attributes reflect the mental operations of the believers; in zootheism
the deities worshiped are zoomorphic, and their attributes continue to
reflect the human mind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Physitheism, in its turn, springs from zootheism. Through contemplation
of the strong the idea of strength arises, and a means is found
for bringing the bear into analogy with thunder, with the sun, or with
the avalanche-bearing mountain; through contemplation of the swift the
concept of swiftness is engendered, and comparison of the deer with
the wind or rushing river is made easy; through contemplation of the
deadly stroke of the rattlesnake the notion of death-dealing power
assumes shape, and comparison of the snake bite and the lightning
stroke is made possible; and in every case it is inevitably perceived
that the agency is stronger, swifter, deadlier than the animal. At
first the agency is not abstracted or dissociated from the parent
zootheistic concept, and the sun is the mightiest animal as among many
peoples, the thunder is the voice of the bear as among different woodland
tribes or the flapping of the wings of the great ancient eagle as
among the Dakota and ¢egiha, while lightning is the great serpent of
the sky as among the Zuñi. Subsequently the zoic concept fades, and
the constant association of human intellectual qualities engenders an
anthropic concept, when the sun becomes an anthropomorphic deity
(perhaps bearing a dazzling mask, as among the Zuñi), and thunder is<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the rumbling of quoits pitched by the shades of old-time giants, as
among different American tribes. Eventually all the leading agencies
of nature are personified in anthropic form, and retain the human attributes
of caprice, love, and hate which are found in the minds of the
believers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Psychotheism is born of physitheism as the anthropomorphic element
in the concept of natural agency gradually fades; but since none of
the aborigines of the United States had passed into the higher stage,
the mode of transition does not require consideration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to be borne in mind that throughout the course of development
of belief, from the beginning of hecastotheism into the borderland of
psychotheism, the dominant characteristic is the vague notion of mystery.
At first the mystery pervades all things and extends in all directions,
representing an indefinite ideal world, which is the counterpart
of the real world with the addition of human qualities. Gradually the
mystery segregates, deepening with respect to animals and disappearing
with respect to inanimate things; and at length the slowly changing
mysteries shape themselves into semiabstractions having a strong
anthropic cast, while the remainder of the earth and the things thereof
gradually become real, though they remain under the spell and dominion
of the mysterious. Thus at every stage the primitive believer is a
mystic—a fatalist in one stage, a beast worshiper in another, a thaumaturgist
in a third, yet ever and first of all a mystic. It is also to be
borne in mind (and the more firmly because of a widespread misapprehension)
that the primitive believer, up to the highest stage attained
by the North American Indian, is not a psychotheist, much less a monotheist.
His "Great Spirit" is simply a great mystery, perhaps vaguely
anthropomorphic, oftener zoomorphic, yet not a spirit, which he is
unable to conceive save by reflection of the white man's concept and
inquiry; and his departed spirit is but a shade, much like that of the
ancient Greeks, the associate and often the inferior of animal shades.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the four stages in development of belief are fundamentally
distinct, they nevertheless overlap in such manner as apparently, and
in a measure really, to coexist and blend. Culture progress is slow.
In biotic development the effect of beneficial modification is felt immediately,
and the modified organs or organisms are stimulated and
strengthened cumulatively, while the unmodified are enfeebled and
paralyzed cumulatively through inactivity and quickly pass toward
atrophy and extinction. Conversely in demotic development, which
is characterized by the persistence of the organisms and by the elimination
of the bad and the preservation of the good among qualities
only, there is a constant tendency toward retardation of progress; for
in savagery and barbarism as in civilization, age commonly produces
conservatism, and at the same time brings responsibility for the conduct
of old and young, so that modification, howsoever beneficial, is<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
measurably held in check, and so that the progress of each generation
buds in the springtime of youth yet is not permitted to fruit until the
winter of old age approaches. Accordingly the mean of demotic progress
tends to lag far behind its foremost advances, and modes of
action and especially of thought change slowly. This is especially true
of beliefs, which, during each generation, are largely vestigial. So the
stages in the evolution of mythologic philosophy overlap widely; there
is probably no tribe now living among whom zootheism has not yet
taken root, though hecastotheism has been found dominant among
different tribes; there is probably no people in the zootheistic stage
who are completely divested of hecastotheistic vestiges; and one of the
curious features of even the most advanced psychotheism is the occasional
outcropping of features inherited from all of the earlier stages.
Yet it is none the less important to discriminate the stages.</p>

<h5 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">THE SIOUAN MYTHOLOGY</h5>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was partly through pioneer study of the Siouan Indians that the
popular fallacy concerning the aboriginal "Great Spirit" gained currency;
and it was partly through the work of Dorsey among the ¢egiha
and Dakota tribes, first as a missionary and afterward as a linguist,
that the early error was corrected. Among these tribes the creation
and control of the world and the things thereof are ascribed to
"wa-ka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>-da" (the term varying somewhat from tribe to tribe), just as
among the Algonquian tribes omnipotence was assigned to "ma-ni-do"
("Manito the Mighty" of "Hiawatha"); yet inquiry shows that
waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da assumes various forms, and is rather a quality than a definite
entity. Thus, among many of the tribes the sun is waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da—not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></span>
waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da, but simply waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da; and among the same
tribes the moon is waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da, and so is thunder, lightning, the stars, the
winds, the cedar, and various other things; even a man, especially a
shaman, might be waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da or a waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da. In addition the term was
applied to mythic monsters of the earth, air, and waters; according to
some of the sages the ground or earth, the mythic under-world, the
ideal upper-world, darkness, etc, were waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da or waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>das. So, too,
the fetiches and the ceremonial objects and decorations were waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da
among different tribes. Among some of the groups various animals
and other trees besides the specially waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da cedar were regarded as
waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>das; as already noted, the horse, among the prairie tribes, was
the waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da dog. In like manner many natural objects and places of
striking character were considered waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da. Thus the term was
applied to all sorts of entities and ideas, and was used (with or without
inflectional variations) indiscriminately as substantive and adjective,
and with slight modification as verb and adverb. Manifestly a
term so protean is not susceptible of translation into the more highly
differentiated language of civilization. Manifestly, too, the idea
expressed by the term is indefinite, and can not justly be rendered into
"spirit," much less into "Great Spirit;" though it is easy to understand<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stand how the superficial inquirer, dominated by definite spiritual
concept, handicapped by unfamiliarity with the Indian tongue, misled by
ignorance of the vague prescriptorial ideation, and perhaps deceived
by crafty native informants or mischievous interpreters, came to adopt
and perpetuate the erroneous interpretation. The term may be translated
into "mystery" perhaps more satisfactorily than into any other
single English word, yet this rendering is at the same time much too
limited and much too definite. As used by the Siouan Indian, waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da
vaguely connotes also "power," "sacred," "ancient," "grandeur,"
"animate," "immortal," and other words, yet does not express with
any degree of fullness and clearness the ideas conveyed by these terms
singly or collectively—indeed, no English sentence of reasonable length
can do justice to the aboriginal idea expressed by the term waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the beliefs of many of the Siouan tribes are lost through the
extinction of the tribesmen or transformed through acculturation, it is
fortunate that a large body of information concerning the myths and
ceremonials of several prairie tribes has been collected. The records
of Carver, Lewis and Clark, Say, Catlin, and Prince Maximilian are of
great value when interpreted in the light of modern knowledge. More
recent researches by Miss Fletcher<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> and by Dorsey<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> are of especial
value, not only as direct sources of information but as a means of
interpreting the earlier writings. From these records it appears that,
in so far as they grasped the theistic concept, the Siouan Indians were
polytheists; that their mysteries or deities varied in rank and power;
that some were good but more were bad, while others combined bad
and good attributes; that they assumed various forms, actual and
imaginary; and that their dispositions and motives resembled those
found among mankind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The organization of the vague Siouan thearchy appears to have
varied from group to group. Among all of the tribes whose beliefs
are known, the sun was an important waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da, perhaps the leading one
potentially, though usually of less immediate consideration than certain
others, such as thunder, lightning, and the cedar tree; among
the Osage the sun was invoked as "grandfather," and among various
tribes there were sun ceremonials, some of which are still maintained;
among the Omaha and Ponka, according to Miss Fletcher, the mythic
thunder-bird plays a prominent, perhaps dominant rôle, and the cedar
tree or pole is deified as its tangible representative. The moon was
waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da among the Osage and the stars among the Omaha and Ponka,
yet they seem to have occupied subordinate positions; the winds and
the four quarters were apparently given higher rank; and, in individual
cases, the mythic water-monsters or earth-deities seem to have occupied
leading positions. On the whole, it may be safe to consider the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sun as the Siouan arch-mystery, with the mythic thunder-bird or
family of thunder-birds as a sort of mediate link between the mysteries
and men, possessing less power but displaying more activity in human
affairs than the remoter waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da of the heavens. Under these controlling
waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>das, other members of the series were vaguely and variably
arranged. Somewhere in the lower ranks, sacred animals—especially
sports, such as the white buffalo cow—were placed, and still lower
came totems and shamans, which, according to Dorsey, were reverenced
rather than worshiped. It is noteworthy that this thearchic arrangement
corresponded in many respects with the hierarchic social organization
of the stock.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Siouan thearchy was invoked and adored by means of forms
and ceremonies, as well as through orisons. The set observances were
highly elaborate; they comprised dancing and chanting, feasting and
fasting, and in some cases sacrifice and torture, the shocking atrocities
of the Mandan and Minitari rites being especially impressive. From
these great collective devotions the ceremonials graded down through
war-dance and hunting-feast to the terpsichorean grace extolled by
Carver, and to individual fetich worship. In general the adoration
expressed fear of the evil rather than love of the good—but this can
hardly be regarded as a distinctive feature, much less a peculiar one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the mystery places were especially distinctive and noteworthy.
Foremost among them was the sacred pipestone quarry near
Big Sioux river, whence the material for the waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>da calumet was
obtained; another was the far-famed Minne-waka<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span> of North Dakota,
not inaptly translated "Devil's lake;" a third was the mystery-rock or
medicine-rock of the Mandan and Hidatsa near Yellowstone river; and
there were many others of less importance. About all of these places
picturesque legends and myths clustered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Siouan mythology is especially instructive, partly because so
well recorded, partly because it so clearly reflects the habits and
customs of the tribesmen and thus gives an indirect reflection of a
well-marked environment. As among so many peoples, the sun is a
prominent element; the ice-monsters of the north and the rain-myths
of the arid region are lacking, and are replaced by the frequent thunder
and the trees shaken by the storm-winds; the mythic creatures are
shaped in the image of the indigenous animals and birds; the myths
center in the local rocks and waters; the mysterious thearchy corresponds
with the tribal hierarchy, and the attributes ascribed to the
deities are those characteristic of warriors and hunters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considering the mythology in relation to the stages in development
of mythologic philosophy, it appears that the dominant beliefs, such as
those pertaining to the sun and the winds, represent a crude physitheism,
while vestiges of hecastotheism crop out in the object-worship
and place-worship of the leading tribes and in other features. At the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same time well-marked zootheistic features are found in the mythic
thunder-birds and in the more or less complete deification of various
animals, in the exaltation of the horse into the rank of the mythic dog
father, and in the animal forms of the water-monsters and earth-beings;
and the living application of zootheism is found in the animal fetiches
and totems. On the whole, it seems just to assign the Siouan mythology
to the upper strata of zootheism, just verging on physitheism, with
vestigial traces of hecastotheism.</p>

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">SOMATOLOGY</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vigorous avocations of the chase and war were reflected in fine
stature, broad and deep chests, strong and clean limbs, and sound constitution
among the Siouan tribesmen and their consorts. The skin
was of the usual coppery cast characteristic of the native American;
the teeth were strong, indicating and befitting a largely carnivorous
diet, little worn by sandy foods, and seldom mutilated; the hands and
feet were commonly large and sinewy. The Siouan Indians were
among those who impressed white pioneers by the parallel placing of
the feet; for, as among other walkers and runners, who rest sitting and
lying, the feet assumed the pedestrian attitude of approximate parallelism
rather than the standing attitude of divergence forward. The
hair was luxuriant, stiff, straight, and more uniformly jet black than
that of the southerly stocks; it was worn long by the women and most
of the men, though partly clipped or shaved in some tribes by the warriors
as well as the worthless dandies, who, according to Catlin, spent
more time over their toilets than ever did the grande dame of Paris.
The women were beardless and the men more or less nearly so; commonly
the men plucked out by the roots the scanty hair springing on
their faces, as did both sexes that on other parts of the body. The
crania were seldom deformed artificially save through cradle accident,
and while varying considerably in capacity and in the ratio of length to
width were usually mesocephalic. The facial features were strong, yet
in no way distinctly unlike those found among neighboring peoples.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the advent of white men the characteristics of the Siouan
Indians, like those of other tribes, have been somewhat modified, partly
through infusion of Caucasian blood but chiefly through acculturation.
With the abandonment of hunting and war and the tardy adoption of
a slothful, semidependent agriculture, the frame has lost something
of its stalwart vigor; with the adaptation of the white man's costume
and the incomplete assimilation of his hygiene, various weaknesses and
disorders have been developed; and through imitation the erstwhile
luxuriant hair is cropped, and the beard, made scanty through generations
of extirpation, is commonly cultivated. Although the accultural
condition of the Siouan survivors ranges from the essentially
primitive status of the Asiniboin to the practical civilization of the
representatives of several tribes, it is fair to consider the stock in a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
state of transition from barbarism to civilization; and many of the
tribesmen are losing the characteristics of activity and somatic development
normal to primitive life, while they have not yet assimilated
the activities and acquired the somatic characteristics normal to peaceful
sedentary life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Briefly, certain somatic features of the Siouan Indians, past and
present, may be traced to their causes in custom and exercise of function;
yet by far the greater number of the features are common to the
American people or to all mankind, and are of ill-understood significance.
The few features of known cause indicate that special somatic
characteristics are determined largely or wholly by industrial and other
arts, which are primarily shaped by environment.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">HABITAT</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Excepting the Asiniboin, who are chiefly in Canada, nearly all of
the Siouan Indians are now gathered on the reservations indicated on
earlier pages, most of these reservations lying within the aboriginal
territory of the stock.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the advent of white men, the Siouan territory was vaguely defined,
and its limits were found to vary somewhat from exploration to exploration.
This vagueness and variability of habitat grew out of the characteristics
of the tribesmen. Of all the great stocks south of the
Arctic, the Siouan was perhaps least given to agriculture, most influenced
by hunting, and most addicted to warfare; thus most of the
tribes were but feebly attached to the soil, and freely followed the movements
of the feral fauna as it shifted with climatic vicissitudes or was
driven from place to place by excessive hunting or by fires set to
destroy the undergrowth in the interests of the chase; at the same
time, the borderward tribes were alternately driven and led back and
forth through strife against the tribes of neighboring stocks. Accordingly
the Siouan habitat can be outlined only in approximate and
somewhat arbitrary fashion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difficulty in defining the priscan home of the Siouan tribes is
increased by its vast extent and scant peopling, by the length of the
period intervening between discovery in the east and complete exploration
in the west, and by the internal changes and migrations which
occurred during this period. The task of collating the records of
exploration and pioneer observation concerning the Siouan and other
stocks was undertaken by Powell a few years ago, and was found to be
of great magnitude. It was at length successfully accomplished, and
the respective areas occupied by the several stocks were approximately
mapped.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As shown on Powell's map, the chief part of the Siouan area comprised
a single body covering most of the region of the Great plains,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stretching from the Rocky mountains to the Mississippi and from the
Arkansas-Red river divide nearly to the Saskatchewan, with an arm
crossing the Mississippi and extending to Lake Michigan. In addition
there were a few outlying bodies, the largest and easternmost bordering
the Atlantic from Santee river nearly to Capes Lookout and Hatteras,
and skirting the Appalachian range northward to the Potomac; the
next considerable area lay on the Gulf coast about Pascagoula river
and bay, stretching nearly from the Pearl to the Mobile; and there were
one or two unimportant areas on Ohio river, which were temporarily
occupied by small groups of Siouan Indians during recent times.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is little probability that the Siouan habitat, as thus outlined,
ran far into the prehistoric age. As already noted, the Siouan Indians
of the plains were undoubtedly descended from the Siouan tribes of the
east (indeed the Mandan had a tradition to that effect); and reason has
been given for supposing that the ancestors of the prairie hunters followed
the straggling buffalo through the cis-Mississippi forests into
his normal trans-Mississippi habitat and spread over his domain save
as they were held in check by alien huntsmen, chiefly of the warlike
Caddoan and Kiowan tribes; and the buffalo itself was a geologically
recent—indeed essentially post-glacial—animal. Little if any definite
trace of Siouan occupancy has been found in the more ancient prehistoric
works of the Mississippi valley. On the whole it appears probable
that the prehistoric development of the Siouan stock and habitat was
exceptionally rapid, that the Siouan Indians were a vigorous and virile
people that arose quickly under the stimulus of strong vitality (the
acquisition of which need not here be considered), coupled with exceptionally
favorable opportunity, to a power and glory culminating about
the time of discovery.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">ORGANIZATION</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The demotic organization of the Siouan peoples, so far as known, is
set forth in considerable detail in Mr Dorsey's treatises<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> and in the
foregoing enumeration of tribes, confederacies, and other linguistic
groups.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like the other aborigines north of Mexico, the Siouan Indians were
organized on the basis of kinship, and were thus in the stage of tribal
society. All of the best-known tribes had reached that plane in organization
characterized by descent in the male line, though many vestiges
and some relatively unimportant examples of descent in the female line
have been discovered. Thus the clan system was obsolescent and the
gentile system fairly developed; i. e., the people were practically out
of the stage of savagery and well advanced in the stage of barbarism.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Confederation for defense and offense was fairly defined and was
strengthened by intermarriage between tribes and gentes and the prohibition
of marriage within the gens; yet the organization was such as to
maintain tribal autonomy in considerable degree; i.e., the social structure
was such as to facilitate union in time of war and division into
small groups adapted to hunting in times of peace. No indication of
feudalism has been found in the stock.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The government was autocratic, largely by military leaders sometimes
(particularly in peace) advised by the elders and priests; the leadership
was determined primarily by ability—prowess in war and the chase and
wisdom in the council,—and was thus hereditary only a little further
than characteristics were inherited; indeed, excepting slight recognition
of the divinity that doth hedge about a king, the leaders were
practically self-chosen, arising gradually to the level determined by
their abilities. The germ of theocracy was fairly developed, and apparently
burgeoned vigorously during each period of peace, only to be
checked and withered during the ensuing war when the shamans and
their craft were forced into the background.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During recent years, since the tribes began to yield to the domination
of the peace-loving whites, the government and election are determined
chiefly by kinship, as appears from Dorsey's researches; yet
definite traces of the militant organization appear, and any man can
win name and rank in his gens, tribe, or confederacy by bravery or
generosity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The institutional connection between the Siouan tribes of the plains
and those of the Atlantic slope and the Gulf coast is completely lost,
and it is doubtful whether the several branches have ever been united
in a single confederation (or "nation," in the language of the pioneers),
at least since the division in the Appalachian region perhaps five or
ten centuries ago. Since this division the tribes have separated widely,
and some of the bloodiest wars of the region in the historic period have
been between Siouan tribes; the most extensive union possessing the
slightest claim to federal organization was the great Dakota confederacy,
which was grown into instability and partial disruption; and
most of the tribal unions and coalitions were of temporary character.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although highly elaborate (perhaps because of this character), the
Siouan organization was highly unstable; with every shock of conflict,
whether intestine or external, some autocrats were displaced or slain;
and after each important event—great battle, epidemic, emigration, or
destructive flood—new combinations were formed. The undoubtedly
rapid development of the stock, especially after the passage of the
Mississippi, indicates growth by conquest and assimilation as well as
by direct propagation (it is known that the Dakota and perhaps other
groups adopted aliens regularly); and, doubtless for this reason in
part, there was a strong tendency toward differentiation and dichotomy
in the demotic growth. In some groups the history is too vague to
indicate this tendency with certainty; in others the tendency is clear.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Perhaps the best example is found in the Cegiha, which divided into two
great branches, the stronger of which threw off minor branches in the
Osage and Kansa, and afterward separated into the Omaha and Ponka,
while the feebler branch also ramified widely; and only less notable is
the example of the Winnebago trunk, with its three great branches in
the Iowa, Oto, and Missouri. This strong divergent tendency in itself
suggests rapid, perhaps abnormally rapid, growth in the stock; for it
outran and partially concealed the tendency toward convergence and
ultimate coalescence which characterizes demotic phenomena.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The half-dozen eastern stocks occupying by far the greater part of
North America contrast strongly with the half-hundred local stocks
covering the Pacific coast; and none of the strong Atlantic stocks is
more characteristic, more sharply contrasted with the limited groups of
the western coast, or better understood as regards organization and
development, than the great Siouan stock of the northern interior.
There is promise that, as the demology of aboriginal America is pushed
forward, the records relating to the Siouan Indians and especially to
their structure and institutions will aid in explaining why some stocks
are limited and others extensive, why large stocks in general characterize
the interior and small stocks the coasts, and why the dominant
peoples of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were successful in displacing
the preexistent and probably more primitive peoples of the
Mississippi valley. While the time is not yet ripe for making final
answer to these inquiries, it is not premature to suggest a relation
between a peculiar development of the aboriginal stocks and a peculiar
geographic conformation: In general the coastward stocks are small,
indicating a provincial shoreland habit, yet their population and area
commonly increase toward those shores indented by deep bays, along
which maritime and inland industries naturally blend; so (confining
attention to eastern United States) the extensive Muskhogean stock
stretches inland from the deep-bayed eastern Gulf coast; and so, too,
three of the largest stocks on the continent (Algonquian, Iroquoian,
Siouan) stretch far into the interior from the still more deeply indented
Atlantic coast. In two of these cases (Iroquoian and Siouan) history
and tradition indicate expansion and migration from the land of bays
between Cape Lookout and Cape May, while in the third there are
similar (though perhaps less definite) indications of an inland drift
from the northern Atlantic bays and along the Laurentian river and
lakes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dakota are mentioned in the Jesuit Relations as early as 1639-40;
the tradition is noted that the Ojibwa, on arriving at the Great Lakes in
an early migration from the Atlantic coast, encountered representatives<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the great confederacy of the plains. In 1641 the French voyageurs
met the Potawatomi Indians flying from a nation called Nadawessi
(enemies); and the Frenchmen adopted the alien name for the warlike
prairie tribes. By 1658 the Jesuits had learned of the existence of
thirty Dakota villages west-northwest from the Potawatomi mission St
Michel; and in 1689 they recorded the presence of tribes apparently
representing the Dakota confederacy on the upper Mississippi, near
the mouth of the St Croix. According to Croghan's History of Western
Pennsylvania, the "Sue" Indians occupied the country southwest of
Lake Superior about 1759; and Dr T.S. Williamson, "the father of the
Dakota mission," states that the Dakota must have resided about the
confluence of the Mississippi and the Minnesota or St Peters for at
least two hundred years prior to 1860.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to traditions collected by Dorsey, the Teton took possession
of the Black Hills region, which had previously been occupied by
the Crow Indians, long before white men came; and the Yankton
and Yanktonnai, which were found on the Missouri by Lewis and Clark,
were not long removed from the region about Minnesota river. In 1862
the Santee and other Dakota tribes united in a formidable outbreak
in which more than 1,000 whites were massacred or slain in battle.
Through this outbreak and the consequent governmental action toward
the control and settlement of the tribes, much was learned concerning
the characteristics of the people, and various Indian leaders became
known; Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, American
Horse, and Even-his-horse-is-feared (commonly miscalled Man-afraid-of-his-horses)
were among the famous Dakota chiefs and warriors, notable
representatives of a passing race, whose names are prominent in
the history of the country. Other outbreaks occurred, the last of note
resulting from the ghost-dance fantasy in 1890-91, which fortunately
was quickly suppressed. Yet, with slight interruptions, the Dakota
tribes in the United States were steadily gathered on reservations.
Some 800 or more still roam the prairies north of the international
boundary, but the great body of the confederacy, numbering nearly
28,000, are domiciled on reservations (already noted) in Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The separation of the Asiniboin from the Wazi-kute gens of the
Yanktonai apparently occurred before the middle of the seventeenth
century, since the Jesuit relation of 1658 distinguishes between the
Poualak or Guerriers (undoubtedly the Dakota proper) and the Assiuipoualak
or Guerriers de pierre. The Asiniboin are undoubtedly the
Essanape (Essanapi or Assinapi) who were next to the Makatapi
(Dakota) in the Walam-Olum record of the Lenni-Lenape or Delaware.
In 1680 Hennepin located the Asiniboin northeast of the Issati (Isanyati
or Santee) who were on Knife lake (Minnesota); and the Jesuit
map of 1681 placed them on Lake-of-the-Woods, then called "L. Assinepoualacs."
La Hontan claimed to have visited the Eokoro (Arikara)<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in 1689-90, when the Essanape were sixty leagues above; and Perrot's
Mémoire refers to the Asiniboin as a Sioux tribe which, in the seventeenth
century, seceded from their nation and took refuge among the
rocks of Lake-of-the-Woods. Chauvignerie located some of the tribe
south of Ounipigan (Winnipeg) lake in 1736, and they were near Lake-of-the-Woods
as late as 1766, when they were said to have 1,500 warriors.
It is well known that in 1829 they occupied a considerable
territory west of the Dakota and north of Missouri river, with a population
estimated at 8,000; and Drake estimated their number at 10,000
before the smallpox epidemic of 1838, which is said to have carried off
4,000. From this blow the tribe seems never to have fully recovered,
and now numbers probably no more than 3,000, mostly in Canada,
where they continue to roam the plains they have occupied for half a
century.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to tribal traditions collected by Dorsey, the ancestors of
the Omaha, Ponka, Elwapa, Osage, and Kansa were originally one
people dwelling on Ohio and Wabash rivers, but gradually working
westward. The first separation took place at the mouth of the Ohio,
when those who went down the Mississippi became the Kwapa or Downstream
People, while those who ascended the great river became the
Omaha or Up-stream People. This separation must have occurred at
least as early as 1500, since it preceded De Soto's discovery of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Omaha group (from whom the Osage, Kansa, and Ponka were
not yet separated) ascended the Mississippi to the mouth of the Missouri,
where they remained for some time, though war and hunting
parties explored the country northwestward, and the body of the tribe
gradually followed these pioneers, though the Osage and Kansa were
successively left behind. Some of the pioneer parties discovered the
pipestone quarry, and many traditions cling about this landmark. Subsequently
they were driven across the Big Sioux by the Yankton Indians,
who then lived toward the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi.
The group gradually differentiated and finally divided through the separation
of the Ponka, probably about the middle of the seventeenth
century. The Omaha gathered south of the Missouri, between the
mouths of the Platte and Niobrara, while the Ponka pushed into the
Black Hills country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Omaha tribe remained within the great bend of the Missouri,
opposite the mouth of the Big Sioux, until white men came. Their
hunting ground extended westward and southwestward, chiefly north
of the Platte and along the Elkhorn, to the territory of the Ponka and
the Pawnee (Caddoan); and in 1766 Carver met their hunting parties
on Minnesota river. Toward the end of the eighteenth century they
were nearly destroyed by smallpox, their number having been reduced
from about 3,500 to but little over 300 when they were visited by Lewis<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Clark, their famous chief Blackbird being one of those carried off
by the epidemic. Subsequently they increased in numbers; in 1890
their population was about 1,200. They are now on reservations, mostly
owning land in severalty, and are citizens of the United States and of
the state of Nebraska.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the name Ponka did not appear in history before 1700 it
must have been used for many generations earlier, since it is an archaic
designation connected with the social organization of several tribes and
the secret societies of the Osage and Kansa, as well as the Ponka. In
1700 the Ponka were indicated on De l'Isle's map, though they were
not then segregated territorially from the Omaha. They, too, suffered
terribly from the smallpox epidemic, and when met by Lewis and Clark
in 1804 numbered only about 200. They increased rapidly, reaching
about 600 in 1829 and some 800 in 1842; in 1871, when they were first
visited by Dorsey, they numbered 747. Up to this time the Ponka and
Dakota were amicable; but a dispute grew out of the cession of lands,
and the Teton made annual raids on the Ponka until the enforced
removal of the tribe to Indian Territory took place in 1877. Through
this warfare, more than a quarter of the Ponka lost their lives. The
displacement of this tribe from lands owned by them in fee simple
attracted attention, and a commission was appointed by President
Hayes in 1880 to inquire into the matter; the commission, consisting
of Generals Crook and Miles and Messrs William Stickney and Walter
Allen, visited the Ponka settlements in Indian Territory and on the
Niobrara and effected a satisfactory arrangement of the affairs of the
tribe, through which the greater portion (some 600) remained in Indian
Territory, while some 225 kept their reservation in Nebraska.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the ¢egiha divided at the mouth of the Ohio, the ancestors
of the Osage and Kansa accompanied the main Omaha body up the
Mississippi to the mouth of Osage river. There the Osage separated
from the group, ascending the river which bears their name. They
were distinguished by Marquette in 1673 as the "Ouchage" and
"Autrechaha," and by Penicaut in 1719 as the "Huzzau," "Ous," and
"Wawha." According to Croghan, they were, in 1759, on "White
creek, a branch of the Mississippi," with the "Grand Tuc;" but"White
creek" (or White water) was an old designation for Osage river, and
"Grand Tuc" is, according to Mooney, a corruption of "Grandes Eaux,"
or Great Osage; and there is accordingly no sufficient reason for supposing
that they returned to the Mississippi. Toward the close of the
eighteenth century the Osage and Kansa encountered the Comanche
and perhaps other Shoshonean peoples, and their course was turned
southward; and in 1817, according to Brown, the Great Osage and
Little Osage were chiefly on Osage and Arkansas rivers, in four villages.
In 1829 Porter described their country as beginning 25 miles
west of the Missouri line and running to the Mexican line of that date,
being 50 miles wide; and he gave their number as 5,000. According to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Schoolcraft, they numbered 3,758 in April, 1853, but this was after the
removal of an important branch known as Black Dog's band to a new
locality farther down Verdigris river. In 1850 the Osage occupied at
least seven large villages, besides numerous small ones, on Neosho and
Verdigris rivers. In 1873, when visited by Dorsey, they were gathered
on their reservations in what is now Oklahoma. In 1890 they numbered
158.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Kansa remained with the Up-stream People in their gradual
ascent of the Missouri to the mouth of the Kaw or Kansas, when they
diverged westward; but they soon came in contact with inimical
peoples, and, like the Osage, were driven southward. The date of this
divergence is not fixed, but it must have been after 1723, when Bourgmont
mentioned a large village of "Quans" located on a small river
flowing northward thirty leagues above Kaw river, near the Missouri.
After the cession of Louisiana to the United States, a treaty was made
with the Kansa Indians, who were then on Kaw river, at the mouth of
the Saline, having been forced back from the Missouri by the Dakota;
they then numbered about 1,500 and occupied about thirty earth lodges.
In 1825 they ceded their lands on the Missouri to the Government,
retaining a reservation on the Kaw, where they were constantly subjected
to attacks from the Pawnee and other tribes, through which large
numbers of their warriors were slain. In 1846 they again ceded their
lands and received a new reservation on Neosho river in Kansas. This
was soon overrun by settlers, when another reservation was assigned
to them in Indian Territory, near the Osage country. By 1890 their
population was reduced to 214.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Kwapa were found by De Soto in 1541 on the Mississippi above
the mouth of the St Francis, and, according to Marquette's map, they
were partly east of the Mississippi in 1673. In 1681 La Salle found
them in three villages distributed along the Mississippi, and soon afterward
Tonty mentioned four villages, one (Kappa = Uʞaqpaqti, "Real
Kwapa") on the Mississippi and three (Toyengan = Ta<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>wa<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">n</span></span>-jiʞa, "Small
Village"; Toriman = Ti-uad¢iman, and Osotonoy = Uzutiuwe) inland;
this observation was verified by Dorsey in 1883 by the discovery that
these names are still in use. In early days the Kwapa were known as
"Akansa," or Arkansa, first noted by La Metairie in 1682. It is probable
that this name was an Algonquian designation given because of
confusion with, or recognition of affinity to, the Kansa or Kanze, the
prefix "a" being a common one in Algouquian appellations. In 1687
Joutel located two of the villages of the tribe on the Arkansas and
two on the Mississippi, one of the latter being on the eastern side.
According to St Cosme, the greater part of the tribe died of smallpox
in October, 1699. In 1700 De l'Isle placed the principal "Acansa"
village on the southern side of Arkansas river; and, according to
Gravier, there were in 1701 five villages, the largest, Imaha (Omaha),
being highest on the Arkansas. In 1805 Sibley placed the "Arkensa"<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in three villages on the southern side of Arkansas river, about 12 miles
above Arkansas post. They claimed to be the original proprietors of
the country bordering the Arkansas for 300 miles, or up to the confluence
of the Cadwa, above which lay the territory of the Osage. Subsequently
the Kwapa affiliated with the Caddo Indians, though of
another stock; according to Porter they were in the Caddo country in
1829. As reservations were established, the Kwapa were re-segregated,
and in 1877 were on their reservation in northwestern Indian Territory;
but most of them afterward scattered, chiefly to the Osage
country, where in 1890 they were found to number 232.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ancestry and prehistoric movements of the tribes constituting
this group are involved in considerable obscurity, though it is known
from tradition as well as linguistic affinity that they sprung from the
Winnebago.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the days of Marquette (1673) the Iowa have ranged over the
country between the Mississippi and Missouri, up to the latitude of
Oneota (formerly upper Iowa) river,- and even across the Missouri
about the mouth of the Platte. Chauvignerie located them, in 1736
west of the Mississippi and (probably through error in identification of
the waterway) south of the Missouri; and in 1761 Jefferys placed them
between Missouri river and the headwaters of Des Moines river, above
the Oto and below the Maha (Omaha). In 1805, according to Drake,
they dwelt on Des Moines river, forty leagues above its mouth, and
numbered 800. In 1811 Pike found them in two villages on Des Moines
and Iowa rivers. In 1815 they were decimated by smallpox, and
also lost heavily through war against the tribes of the Dakota confederacy.
In 1829 Porter placed them on the Little Platte, some 15 miles
from the Missouri line, and about 1853 Schoolcraft located them on
Nemaha river, their principal village being near the mouth of the
Great Nemaha. In 1848 they suffered another epidemic of smallpox,
by which 100 warriors, besides women and children, were carried off.
As the country settled, the Iowa, like the other Indians of the stock,
were collected on reservations which they still occupy in Kansas and
Oklahoma. According to the last census their population was 273.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Missouri were first seen by Tonty about 1670; they were located
near the Mississippi on Marquette's map (1673) under the name of
Ouemessourit, probably a corruption of their name by the Illinois
tribe, with the characteristic Algonquian prefix. The name Missouri
was first used by Joutel in 1687. In 1723 Bourgmont located their
principal village 30 leagues below Kaw river and 60 leagues below
the chief settlement of the Kansa; according to Groghan, they were
located on Mississippi river opposite the Illinois country in 1759.
Although the early locations are somewhat indefinite, it seems certain
that the tribe formerly dwelt on the Mississippi about the mouth of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Missouri, and that they gradually ascended the latter stream,
remaining for a time between Grand and Chariton rivers and establishing
a town on the left bank of the Missouri near the mouth of the
Grand. There they were found by French traders, who built a fort on
an island quite near their village about the beginning of the eighteenth
century. Soon afterward they were conquered and dispersed by a
combination of Sac, Fox, and other Indians; they also suffered from
smallpox. On the division, five or six lodges joined the Osage, two or
three took refuge with the Kansa, and most of the remainder amalgamated
with the Oto. In 1805 Lewis and Clark found a part of the
tribe, numbering about 300, south of Platte river. The only known
survivors in 1829 were with the Oto, when they numbered no more
than 80. In 1842 their village stood on the southern bank of Platte
river near the Oto settlement, and they followed the latter tribe to
Indian Territory in 1882.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to Winnebago tradition, the ʇɔiwe're tribes separated from
that "People of the parent speech" long ago, the Iowa being the first
and the Oto the last to leave. In 1673 the Oto were located by Marquette
west of Missouri river, between the fortieth and fortyfirst
parallels; in 1680 they were 130 leagues from the Illinois, almost opposite
the mouth of the Miskoncing (Wisconsin), and in 1687 they were
on Osage river. According to La Hontan they were, in 1690, on Otontas
(Osage) river; and in 1698 Hennepin placed them ten days' journey
from Fort Crève Cœur. Iberville, in 1700, located the Iowa and Oto
with the Omaha, between Wisconsin and Missouri rivers, about 100
leagues from the Illinois tribe; and Charlevoix, in 1721, fixed the Oto
habitat as below that of the Iowa and above that of the Kansa on the
western side of the Missouri. Dupratz mentions the Oto as a small
nation on Missouri river in 1758, and Jefferys (1761) described them
as occupying the southern bank of the Panis (Platte) between its mouth
and the Pawnee territory; according to Porter, they occupied the same
position in 1829. The Oto claimed the land bordering the Platte from
their village to the mouth of the river, and also that on both sides of the
Missouri as far as the Big Nemaha. In 1833 Catlin found the Oto and
Missouri together in the Pawnee country; about 1841 they were gathered
in four villages on the southern side of the Platte, from 5 to 18
miles above its mouth. In 1880 a part of the tribe removed to the Sac
and Fox reservation in Indian Territory, where they still remain; in
1882 the rest of the tribe, with the remnant of the Missouri, emigrated
to the Pouka, Pawnee, and Oto reservation in the present Oklahoma,
where, in 1890 they were found to number 400.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Linguistically the Winnebago Indians are closely related to the
ʇɔiwe're on the one side and to the Mandan on the other. They were
first mentioned in the Jesuit Relation of 1636, though the earliest<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
known use of the name Winnebago occurs in the Relation of 1640;
Nicollet found them on Green bay in 1639. According to Shea, the
Winnebago were almost annihilated by the Illinois (Algonquian) tribe in
early days, and the historical group was made up of the survivors of
the early battles. Cbauvignerie placed the Winnebago on Lake Superior
in 1736, and Jefferys referred to them and the Sac as living near
the head of Green bay in 1761; Carver mentions a Winnebago village
on a small island near the eastern end of Winnebago lake in 1778.
Pike enumerated seven Winnebago villages existing in 1811; and in
1822 the population of the tribe was estimated at 5,800 (including 900
warriors) in the country about Winnebago lake and extending thence
southwestward to the Mississippi. By treaties in 1825 and 1832 they
ceded their lands south of Wisconsin and Fox rivers for a reservation
on the Mississippi above the Oneota; one of their villages in 1832 was
at Prairie la Grosse. They suffered several visitations of smallpox;
the third, which occurred in 1836, carried off more than a quarter of
the tribe. A part of the people long remained widely distributed over
their old country east of the Mississippi and along that river in Iowa
and Minnesota; in 1840 most of the tribe removed to the neutral ground
in the then territory of Iowa; in 1846 they surrendered their reservation
for another above the Minnesota, and in 1856 they were removed
to Blue Earth, Minnesota. Here they were mastering agriculture, when
the Sioux war broke out and the settlers demanded their removal.
Those who had taken up farms, thereby abandoning tribal rights, were
allowed to remain, but the others were transferred to Crow creek, on
Missouri river, whence they soon escaped. Their privations and sufferings
were terrible; out of 2,000 taken to Crow creek only 1,200 reached
the Omaha reservation, whither most of them fled. They were assigned
a new reservation on the Omaha lands, where they now remain, occupying
lands allotted in severalty. In 1890 there were 1,215 Winnebago
on the reservation, but nearly an equal number were scattered over
Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where they now live chiefly
by agriculture, with a strong predilection for hunting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mandan had a vague tradition of emigration from the eastern
part of the country, and Lewis and Clark, Prince Maximilian, and
others found traces of Mandan house-structures at various points
along the Missouri; thus they appear to have ascended that stream
before the advent of the ¢egiha. During the historical period their
movements were limited; they were first visited in the upper Missouri
country by Sieur de la Verendrye in 1738. About 1750 they established
two villages on the eastern side and seven on the western side of
the Missouri, near the mouth of Heart river. Here they were assailed
by the Asiniboin and Dakota and attacked by smallpox, and were
greatly reduced; the two eastern villages consolidated, and the people<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
migrated up the Missouri to a point 1,430 miles above its mouth (as
subsequently determined by Lewis and Clark); the seven villages were
soon reduced to five, and these people also ascended the river and
formed two villages in the Arikara country, near the Mandan of the
eastern side, where they remained until about 1766, when they also
consolidated. Thus the once powerful and populous tribe was reduced
to two villages which, in 1804, were found by Lewis and Clark on
opposite banks of the Missouri, about 4 miles below Knife river. Here
for a time the tribe waxed and promised to regain the early prestige,
reaching a population of 1,600 in 1837; but in that year they were again
attacked by smallpox and almost annihilated, the survivors numbering
only 31 according to one account, or 125 to 145 according to others.
After this visitation they united in one village. When the Hidatsa
removed from Knife river in 1845, some of the Mandan accompanied
them, and others followed at intervals as late as 1858, when only a few
still remained at their old home. In 1872 a reservation was set apart
for the Hidatsa and Arikara and the survivors of the Mandan on Missouri
and Yellowstone rivers in Dakota and Montana, but in 1886 the
reservation was reduced. According to the census returns, the Mandan
numbered 252 in 1890.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There has been much confusion concerning the definition and designation
of the Hidatsa Indians. They were formerly known as Minitari
or Gros Ventres of the Missouri, in distinction from the Gros Ventres
of the plains, who belong to another stock. The origin of the term
Gros Ventres is somewhat obscure, and various observers have pointed
out its inapplicability, especially to the well-formed Hidatsa tribesmen.
According to Dorsey, the French pioneers probably translated a native
term referring to a traditional buffalo paunch, which occupies a prominent
place in the Hidatsa mythology and which, in early times, led to
a dispute and the separation of the Crow from the main group some
time in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earlier legends of the Hidatsa are vague, but there is a definite
tradition of a migration northward, about 1765, from the neighborhood
of Heart river, where they were associated with the Mandan, to Knife
river. At least as early as 1796, according to Matthews, there were
three villages belonging to this tribe on Knife river—one at the mouth,
another half a mile above, and the third and largest 3 miles from the
mouth. Here the people were found by Lewis and Clark in 1804, and
here they remained until 1837, when the scourge of smallpox fell and
many of the people perished, the survivors uniting in a single village.
About 1845 the Hidatsa and a part of the Mandan again migrated up
the Missouri, and established a village 30 miles by land and 60 miles
by water above their old home, within what is now Fort Berthold reservation.
Their population has apparently varied greatly, partly by<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reason of the ill definition of the tribe by different enumerators, partly
by reason of the inroads of smallpox. In 1890 they numbered 522.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Crow people are known by the Hidatsa as Kihatsa (They-refused-the-paunch),
according to Matthews; and Dorsey points out that their
own name, Absaruke, does not mean " crow," but refers to a variety of
hawk. Lewis and Clark found the tribe in four bands. In 1817 Brown
located them on Yellowstone river. In 1829 they were described by
Porter as ranging along Yellowstone river on the eastern side of the
Bocky mountains, and numbered at 4,000; while in 1834, according to
Drake, they occupied the southern branch of the Yellowstone, about
the fortysixth parallel and one hundred and fifth meridian, with a
population of 4,500. In 1842 their number was estimated at 4,000, and
they were described as inhabiting the headwaters of the Yellowstone.
They have since been duly gathered on the Crow reservation in Montana,
and are slowly adopting civilization. In 1890 they numbered
2,287.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reviewing the records of explorers and pioneers and the few traditions
which have been preserved, the course of Siouan migration and
development becomes clear. In general the movements were westward
and northwestward. The Dakota tribes have not been traced far,
though several of them, like the Yanktonnai, migrated hundreds of
miles from the period of first observation to the end of the eighteenth
century; then came the Mandan, according to their tradition, and as
they ascended the Missouri left traces of their occupancy scattered
over 1,000 miles of migration; next the ¢egiha descended the Ohio
and passed from the cis-Mississippi forests over the trans-Mississippi
plains—the stronger branch following the Mandan, while the lesser at
first descended the great river and then worked up the Arkansas into
the buffalo country until checked and diverted by antagonistic tribes.
So also the ʇɔiwe're, first recorded near the Mississippi, pushed 300
miles westward; while the Winnebago gradually emigrated from the
region of the Great Lakes into the trans-Mississippi country even
before their movements were affected by contact with white men. In
like manner the Hidatsa are known to have flowed northwestward
many scores of miles; and the Asiniboin swept more rapidly across the
plains from the place of their rebellion against the Yanktonnai, on the
Mississippi, before they found final resting place on the Saskatchewan<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plains 500 or 800 miles away. All of the movements were consistent
and, despite intertribal friction and strife, measurably harmonious. The
lines of movement, so far as they can be restored, are in full accord
with the lines of linguistic evolution traced by Hale and Dorsey and
Gatschet, and indicate that some five hundred or possibly one thousand
years ago the tribesmen pushed over the Appalachians to the Ohio and
followed that stream and its tributaries to the Mississippi (though there
are faint indications that some of the early emigrants ascended the
northern tributaries to the region of the Great Lakes); and that the
human flood gained volume as it advanced and expanded to cover
the entire region of the plains. The records concerning the movement
of this great human stream find support in the manifest reason for the
movement; the reason was the food quest by which all primitive men
are led, and its end was the abundant fauna of the prairieland, with the
buffalo at its head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the early population of the Siouan stock, when first the huntsmen
crossed the Appalachians, may not be known, the lines of migration
indicate that the people increased and multiplied amain during
their long journey, and that their numbers culminated, despite external
conflict and internal strife, about the beginning of written history,
when the Siouan population may have been 100,000 or more. Then
came war against the whites and the still more deadly smallpox,
whereby the vigorous stock was checked and crippled and the population
gradually reduced; but since the first shock, which occurred at
different dates in different parts of the great region, the Siouan people
have fairly held their own, and some branches are perhaps gaining in
strength.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As shown by Powell, there are two fundamentally distinct classes or
stages in human society—(1) tribal society and (2) national society.
National society characterizes civilization; primarily it is organized on
a territorial basis, but as enlightenment grows the bases are multiplied.
Tribal society is characteristic of savagery and barbarism; so
far as known, all tribal societies are organized on the basis of kinship.
The transfer from tribal society to national society is often, perhaps
always, through feudalism, in which the territorial motive takes root
and in which the kinship motive withers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All of the American aborigines north of Mexico and most of those
farther southward were in the stage of tribal society when the continents
were discovered, though feudalism was apparently budding in
South America, Central America, and parts of Mexico. The partly
developed transitional stage may, for the present, be neglected, and
American Indian sociology may be considered as representing tribal
society or kinship organization.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fundamental principles of tribal organization through kinship
have been formulated by Powell; they are as follows:<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a></p>

brother-group may also constitute a father-group and grandfather-group, a son-group
and a grandson-group. It may also be a patruate-group and an avunculate group.
It may also be a patruate cousin-group and an avunculate cousin-group;
and in general, every member of a brother-group has the same consanguineal relation
to persons outside of the group as that of every other member.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two postulates concerning primitive society, adopted by various ethnologic
students of other countries, have been erroneously applied to
the American aborigines; at the same time they have been so widely
accepted as to demand consideration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first postulate is that primitive men were originally assembled
in chaotic hordes, and that organized society was developed out of the
chaotic mass by the segregation of groups and the differentiation of
functions within each group. Now the American aborigines collectively
represent a wide range in development, extending from a condition
about as primitive as ever observed well toward the verge of
feudalism, and thus offer opportunities for testing the postulate; and
it has been found that when higher and lower stages representing any
portion of the developmental succession are compared, the social organizations
of the lower grade are no less definite, perhaps more definite,
than those pertaining to the higher grade; so that when the history of
demotic growth among the American Indians is traced backward, the
organizations are found on the whole to grow more definite, albeit more
simple. When the lines of development revealed through research are
projected still farther toward their origin, they indicate an initial condition,
directly antithetic to the postulated horde, in which the scant
population was segregated in small discrete bodies, probably family
groups; and that in each of these bodies there was a definite organization,
while each group was practically independent of, and probably<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inimical to, all other groups. The testimony of the observed institutions
is corroborated by the testimony of language, which, as clearly
shown by Powell,<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> represents progressive combination rather than continued
differentiation, a process of involution rather than evolution.
It would appear that the original definitely organized groups occasionally
met and coalesced, whereby changes in organization were required;
that these compound groups occasionally coalesced with other groups,
both simple and compound, whereby they were elaborated in structure,
always with some loss in definiteness and permanence; and that gradually
the groups enlarged by incorporation, while the composite organization
grew complex and variable to meet the ever-changing conditions.
It would also appear that in some cases the corporeal growth
outran the structural or institutional growth, when the bodies—clans,
gentes, tribes, or confederacies—split into two or more fragments which
continued to grow independently; yet that in general the progress of
institutional developmentwent forward through incorporation of peoples
and differentiation of institutions. The same process was followed as
tribal society passed into national society; and it is the same process
which is today exalting national society into world society, and transforming
simple civilization into enlightenment. Thus the evoluffon of
social organization is from the simple and definite toward the complex
and variable; or from the involuntary to the voluntary; or from the
environment-shaped to the environment-shaping; or from the biotic to
the demotic.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second postulate, which may be regarded as a corollary of the
first, is that the primary conjugal condition was one of promiscuity,
out of which different forms ot marriage were successively segregated.
Now the wide range in institutional development exemplified by the
American Indians affords unprecedented opportunities for testing this
postulate also. The simplest demotic unit found among the aborigines
is the clan or mother-descent group, in which the normal conjugal relation
is essentially monogamous,<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> in which marriage is more or less
strictly regulated by a system of prohibitions, and in which the chief
conjugal regulation is commonly that of exogamy with respect to the
clan; in higher groups, more deeply affected by contact with neighboring
peoples, the simple clan organization is sometimes found to be
modified, (1) by the adoption and subsequent conjugation of captive
men and boys, and, doubtless more profoundly, (2) by the adoption
and polygamous marriage of female captives; and in still more highly
organized groups the mother-descent is lost and polygamy is regular
and limited only by the capacity of the husband as a provider. The
second and third stages are commonly characterized, like the first,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by established prohibitions and by clan exogamy; though with the
advance in organization amicable relations with certain other groups
are usually established, whereby the germ of tribal organization is
implanted and a system of interclan marriage, or tribal endogamy, is
developed. With further advance the mother-descent group is transformed
into a father-descent group, when the clan is replaced by the
gens; and polygamy is a common feature of the gentile organization.
In all of these stages the conjugal and consanguineal regulations are
affected by the militant habits characteristic of primitive groups; more
warriors than women are slain in battle, and there are more female
captives than male; and thus the polygamy is mainly or wholly
polygyny. In many cases civil conditions combine with or partially
replace the militant conditions, yet the tendency of conjugal development
is not changed. Among the Seri Indians, probably the most
primitive tribe in North America, in which the demotic unit is the
clan, there is a rigorous marriage custom under which the would-be
groom is required to enter the family of the girl and demonstrate (1)
his capacity as a provider and (2) his strength of character as a man,
by a year's probation, before he is finally accepted—the conjugal theory
ofr the tribe being monogamy, though the practice, at least during
recent years, has, by reason of conditions, passed into polygyny.
Among several other tribes of more provident and less exclusive habit,
the first of the two conditions recognized by the Seri is met by rich
presents (representing accumulated property) from the groom to the
girl's family, the second condition being usually ignored, the clan
organization remaining in force; among still other tribes the first condition
is more or less vaguely recognized, though the voluntary present
is commuted into, or replaced by, a negotiated value exacted by the
girl's family, when the mother-descent is commonly vestigial; and in
the next stage, which is abundantly exemplified, wife-purchase prevails,
and the clan is replaced by the gens. In this succession the
development of wife-purchase and the decadence of mother-descent
maybe traced, and it is significant that there is a tendency first toward
partial enslavement of the wife and later toward the multiplication of
wives to the limit of the husband's means, and toward transforming
all, or all but one, of the wives into menials. Thus the lines of development
under militant and civil conditions are essentially parallel. It
is possible to project these lines some distance backward into the
unknown, of the exceedingly primitive, when they, are found to define
small discrete bodies—just such as are indicated by the institutional
and linguistic lines—probably family groups, which must have been
essentially, and were perhaps strictly, monogamous. It would appear
that in these groups mating was either between distant members
(under a law of attraction toward the remote and repulsion from the
near, which is shared by mankind and the higher animals), or the result
of accidental meeting between nubile members of different groups;
that in the second case and sometimes in the first the conjugation<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
produced a new monogamic family; and that sometimes in the first case
(and possibly in the second) the new group retained a more or less
definite connection with the parent group—this connection constituting
the germ of the clan. In passing, it may be noted merely that this
inferential origin of the lines of institutional development is in accord
with the habits of certain higher and incipiently organized animals.
From this hypothetic beginning, primitive marriage may be traced
through the various observed stages of monogamy and polygamy and
concubinage and wife-subordination, through savagery and barbarism
and into civilization, with its curious combination of exoteric monogamy
and esoteric promiscuity. Fortunately the burden of the proof
of this evolution does not now rest wholly on the evidence obtained
among the American aborigines; for Westermarck has recently reviewed
the records of observation among the primitive peoples of many
lands, and has found traces of the same sequence in all.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> Thus the
evolution of marriage, like that of other human institutions, is from
the simple and definite to the complex and variable; i.e., from approximate
or complete monogamy through polygamy to a mixed status of
undetermined signification; or from the mechanical to the spontaneous;
or from the involuntary to the voluntary; or from the provincial to the
cosmopolitan.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As implied in several foregoing paragraphs, and as clearly set forth
in various publications by Powell, tribal society falls into two classes
or stages—(1) clan organization and (2) gentile organization, these
stages corresponding respectively to savagery and barbarism, strictly
defined.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time of discovery, most of the American Indians were in the
upper stages of savagery and the lower stages of barbarism, as defined
by organization; among some tribes descent was reckoned in the female
line, though definite matriarchies have not been discovered; among
several tribes descent was and still is reckoned in the male line, and
among all of the tribes thus far investigated the patriarchal system is
found.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In tribal society, both clan and gentile, the entire social structure is
based on real or assumed kinship, and a large part of the demotic
devices are designed to establish, perpetuate, and advertise kinship
relations. As already indicated, the conspicuous devices in order of
development are the taboo with the prohibitions growing out of it,
kinship nomenclature and regulations, and a system of ordination by
which incongruous things are brought into association.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the American Indians the taboo and derivative prohibitions
are used chiefly in connection with marriage and clan or gentile organization.
Marriage in the clan or gens is prohibited; among many tribes
a vestige of the inferential primitive condition is found in the curious<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prohibition of communications between children-in-law and parents-in-law;
the clan taboos are commonly connected with the tutelar beast-god,
perhaps represented by a totem.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The essential feature of the kinship terminology is the reckoning
from ego, whereby each individual remembers his own relation to every
other member of the clan or tribe; and commonly the kinship terms
are classific rather than descriptive (i.e., a single term expresses the
relation which in English is expressed by the phrase "My elder
brother's second son's wife"). The system is curiously complex and
elaborate. It was not discovered by the earlier and more superficial
observers of the Indians, and was brought out chiefly by Morgan, who
detected numerous striking examples among different tribes; but it
would appear that the system is not equally complete among all of the
tribes, probably because of immature development in some cases and
because of decadence in others.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system of ordination, like that of kinship, is characterized by
reckoning from the ego and by adventitious associations. It may have
been developed from the kinship system through the need for recognition
and assignment of adopted captives, collective property, and other
things pertaining to the group; yet it bears traces of influence by the
taboo system. Its ramifications are wide: In some cases it emphasizes
kinship by assigning members of the family group to fixed positions
about the camp-fire or in the house; this function develops into the
placement of family groups in fixed order, as exemplified in the Iroquoian
long-house and the Siouan camping circle; or it develops into a
curiously exaggerated direction-concept culminating in the cult of the
Four Quarters and the Here, and this prepares the way for a quinary,
decimal, and vigesimal numeration; this last branch sends off another
in which the cult of the Six Quarters and the Here arises to prepare
the way for the mystical numbers 7, 13, and 7x7, whose vestiges come
down to civilization; both the four-quarter and the six-quarter associations
are sometimes bound up with colors; and there are numberless
other ramifications. Sometimes the function and development of these
curious concepts, which constitute perhaps the most striking characteristic
of prescriptorial culture, are obscure at first glance, and hardly
to be discovered even through prolonged research; yet, so far as they
have been detected and interpreted, they are especially adapted to fixing
demotic relations; and through them the manifold relations of individuals
and groups are crystallized and kept in mind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the American Indians, including the Siouan stock, are made up
of families organized into clans or gentes, and combined in tribes,
sometimes united in confederacies, all on a basis of kinship, real or
assumed; and the organization is shaped and perpetuated by a series
of devices pertaining to the plane of prescriptorial culture, whereby
each member of the organization is constantly reminded of his position
in the group.</p>

of the domestic dog, so common in the villages of the Indians of this region [about Council Bluffs
and Omaha], some of the varieties of which still retain much of the habit and manners of this
species." James says (loc. cit., vol. II, p. 13), "The dogs of the Konzas are generally of a mixed breed,
between our dogs with pendent ears and the native dogs, whose ears are universally erect. The
Indians of this nation seek every opportunity to cross the breed. These mongrel dogs are less common
with the Omawhaws, while the dogs of the Pawnees generally have preserved their original
form."</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_27" name="note_27" href="#noteref_27">27.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Travels in the Interior of North America; London, 1843. The Prince adds, "In shape they differ
very little from the wolf, and are equally large and strong. Some are of the real wolf color; others
are black, white, or spotted with black and white, and differing only by the tail being rather more
turned up. Their voice is not a proper barking, but a howl like that of the wolf, and they partly
descend from wolves, which approach the Indian huts, even in the daytime, and mix with the dogs"
(cf. p. 203 et al.). Writing at the Mandan village, he says, "The Mandans and Manitaries have not, by
any means, so many dogs as the Assiniboin, Crows, and Blackfeet. They are rarely of true wolf
color, but generally black or white, or else resemble the wolf, but here they are more like the prairie
wolf (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canis latrans</span></span>). We likewise found among these animals a brown race, descended from European
pointers; hence the genuine bark of the dog is more frequently heard here, whereas among the western
nations they only howl. The Indian dogs are worked very hard, have hard blows and hard fare; in
fact, they are treated just as this fine animal is treated among the Esquimaux" (p. 345).</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_28" name="note_28" href="#noteref_28">28.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Letters and Notes," etc, vol.

            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
